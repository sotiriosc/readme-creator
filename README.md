### Motivation

To create an application that creates README. (THIS READ ME WAS CREATED USING THIS APP)

To make developers lives easier.

### Solve

It solves the tedious time of coding and creating a README.

### Learn

I improved my Javascript code. I learned and developed new coding skills to execute my functions more efficiently. I now can deconstruct arrays to make it easier to access unique values. I utilized template literals to construct my README template. I had a lot of fun.
